# Simba ODBC Connector
__Open Data Base Connectivity (ODBC)__ acts as a middle layer between the application and the database, hence making the application programming independent of the database being used. i.e., _ODBC converts the application commands into respective DB commands and the DB results into a format that application will understand_.
